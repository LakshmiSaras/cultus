TASK 1: Generate Synthetic Multivariate Financial Dataset
✔ Requirements Covered

Minimum 5 features ✅

Minimum 2000 observations ✅

Must simulate:

Correlated financial assets ✅

Non-stationarity ✅

Volatility changes ✅

✔ What We Did

Generated 5 synthetic assets with starting price = 100

Created correlation between assets using Cholesky decomposition

Simulated non-stationarity using a drift term (trend over time)

Simulated volatility clustering using a GARCH-like recursive variance formula

Produced 2500 time steps

✔ Outcome

A realistic financial dataset with:

Trend

Correlation

Volatility spikes

Market-like randomness

🔹 TASK 2: Feature Engineering Pipeline
✔ Requirements Covered

Sequence creation for LSTM input ✅

Look-back window defined ✅

Scaling strategy used ✅

✔ What We Did

For each asset we engineered:

Feature	Why
Returns	Captures momentum
Moving Average (10)	Short-term trend
Moving Average (30)	Long-term trend
Rolling Volatility	Market risk
✔ Scaling

Used RobustScaler
👉 Better than MinMax because financial data has outliers

✔ Sequence Creation

Look-back window = 30 time steps

Input shape to LSTM:

(samples, 30 timesteps, number_of_features)

🔹 TASK 3: Design & Train Optimized LSTM Model
✔ Requirements Covered

TensorFlow/Keras model ✅

Hyperparameter tuning (manual) ✅

Minimize forecasting error ✅

✔ LSTM Architecture
Layer	Units	Purpose
LSTM	128	Capture long-term dependencies
Dropout	0.3	Prevent overfitting
LSTM	64	Higher-level sequence learning
Dropout	0.3	Regularization
Dense	32	Feature compression
Dense	1	Forecast output
✔ Hyperparameters Tuned

Lookback window = 30

Units = 128 → 64

Dropout = 0.3

Batch size = 32

EarlyStopping patience = 10

🔹 TASK 4: Comparative Analysis with Baseline Model
✔ Requirement Covered

Train a non-deep learning model and compare results

✔ Baseline Used: SARIMAX (1,1,1)
LSTM	SARIMAX
Learns nonlinear patterns	Only linear relationships
Uses multivariate features	Uses only past values
Handles volatility patterns	Cannot adapt to regime changes

✔ Both models evaluated on the same test data

🔹 TASK 5: Comprehensive Analysis Section
✔ Optimization Choices

Larger first LSTM layer for memory retention

Dropout for overfitting prevention

RobustScaler for stable training

✔ Validation Strategy

Chronological split (NO data leakage)

80% training, 20% testing

Validation split inside training

Early stopping used

✔ Final Metrics Used

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
