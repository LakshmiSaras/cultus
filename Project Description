#PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Title:
Advanced Multivariate Time Series Forecasting using LSTM on Synthetic Financial Data

This project focuses on building a deep learning–based forecasting system for financial time series using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Instead of using a simple dataset, we simulate a realistic stock-market-like environment with:

Multiple correlated assets

Volatility clustering (GARCH-like behavior)

Non-stationarity

Trend and risk dynamics

The goal is to design an optimized LSTM model that can learn nonlinear temporal dependencies and compare its performance with a traditional statistical baseline model (SARIMAX).

This project demonstrates:

Time series simulation

Advanced feature engineering

Sequence modeling using LSTMs

Model tuning & regularization

Comparative performance analysis

🧠 STEP-BY-STEP EXPLANATION
🔹 STEP 1: Synthetic Financial Data Generation

We programmatically generate a dataset that mimics real financial markets.

✔ What we simulated

5 correlated assets

2500 time steps

Market drift (average growth)

Volatility clustering (like GARCH)

Correlated price movements using Cholesky decomposition

✔ Why this is important
Real financial data has:

Sudden spikes

Changing volatility

Assets influencing each other
Our synthetic data captures all these behaviors.

🔹 STEP 2: Feature Engineering

Raw prices are not enough. We create informative features.

For each asset we compute:

Feature	Purpose
Returns	Momentum and direction of movement
10-day Moving Average	Short-term trend
30-day Moving Average	Long-term trend
Rolling Volatility	Market risk level

✔ These features help the LSTM understand trend + risk + momentum

🔹 STEP 3: Data Preprocessing

✔ Missing values removed
✔ Features scaled using RobustScaler (handles outliers better than MinMax)
✔ Data converted into sequences using a lookback window

Lookback = 30
This means the model uses the past 30 time steps to predict the next value.

🔹 STEP 4: Sequence Creation for LSTM

LSTMs require 3D input:

(samples, time_steps, features)


So we transform the data into sequences:

Input → Last 30 days of features

Output → Next value of Asset_0

This allows the model to learn temporal dependencies.

🔹 STEP 5: LSTM Model Architecture
Layer	Description
LSTM (128 units)	Learns long-term dependencies
Dropout (0.3)	Reduces overfitting
LSTM (64 units)	Extracts higher-level patterns
Dropout (0.3)	Regularization
Dense (32)	Nonlinear feature learning
Dense (1)	Final forecast output

✔ Activation: ReLU in Dense layer
✔ Optimizer: Adam
✔ Loss: Mean Squared Error

🔹 STEP 6: Model Training Strategy

✔ 80% training, 20% testing
✔ Validation split from training data
✔ EarlyStopping used to prevent overfitting
✔ Model learns until validation loss stops improving

This ensures the model generalizes well.

🔹 STEP 7: Baseline Statistical Model (SARIMAX)

To compare deep learning with traditional methods, we train:

SARIMAX (1,1,1)

✔ Captures linear time dependencies
✔ Cannot model nonlinear patterns
✔ Serves as performance benchmark

🔹 STEP 8: Model Evaluation Metrics

We use 3 industry-standard forecasting metrics:

Metric	Meaning
MAE	Average absolute prediction error
RMSE	Penalizes large errors more
MAPE	Percentage error (scale independent)

These metrics are computed for both LSTM and SARIMAX.

🔹 STEP 9: Results Visualization

We plot:

Actual values

LSTM predictions

This visually shows how closely the model tracks real movements.

📊 MODEL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY
Model	Strengths	Weaknesses
LSTM	Learns nonlinear patterns, captures volatility and cross-asset influence	Requires more computation
SARIMAX	Simple and interpretable	Cannot model complex relationships

Conclusion:
LSTM outperforms SARIMAX because financial markets are nonlinear and dynamic.
